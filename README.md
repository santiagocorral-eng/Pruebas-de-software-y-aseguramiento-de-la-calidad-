# Programming Exercises – Python

This repository contains three Python programs developed as part of a programming assignment.
All programs were implemented using Python and follow the PEP-8 coding standard.

## Programs Included

1. **computeStatistics.py**
   - Computes descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, and standard deviation)
   - Reads numeric data from a file
   - Handles invalid data and continues execution

2. **convertNumbers.py**
   - Converts decimal numbers to binary and hexadecimal
   - Uses basic algorithms without built-in conversion functions

3. **wordCount.py**
   - Counts distinct words and their frequency in a text file
   - Handles invalid data gracefully

## Execution

Each program is executed from the command line using the following format:

```bash
python3 program_name.py input_file.txt
